# Guitar Scroll Buddy (with Tuner)

This project is the Guitar Scroll Buddy app extended with a minimal digital-bar tuner for the six guitar strings (E2 A2 D3 G3 B3 E4).

Open in Android Studio, grant microphone permission, go to the Tuner tab, and press Start. The bar represents tune offset (-50..+50 cents) and shows detected frequency and target note.
